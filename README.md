# Introduction
Color Painter is a tool for building wonderful color gradients on webpage.  
It based on Three.js, and you can change the color scheme to whatever colors you like.



# How to setup it 
After download or clone the whole project, you don't need to install anything to run it. I recommond you to open a local server like:

``` python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000```

and then enter into the main path, you'll see the interface as this:
